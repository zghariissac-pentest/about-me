# ZGHARI ISSAC , messing around with security since the age of 15.

18 y/o cyber explorer from Algeria.
I’m not claiming to be a pro , I just like figuring out how stuff works, breaking it in safe ways, and learning what actually happens when systems get weird.

Most of my time is spent inside labs I build for myself, poking, testing, breaking, and seeing what sticks. I write down what I notice so it’s not just chaos , but I like it messy enough that it still feels real.

# About Me

I’m drawn to systems, networks, and weird setups.
I experiment, play with ideas, and see patterns. Sometimes it’s just for fun, sometimes it sparks a bigger insight.

I care about:

understanding behaviors

documenting thoughts clearly, even if the experiment fails

safe and responsible exploration , real-world systems get touched only with permission

Basically, I like to tinker, figure things out, and share what I’ve learned without pretending it’s polished.

What I Do (in short)

Think of it as curiosity + experimentation + notes.
I look at systems, networks, virtualization, risks, patterns, and sometimes random weird things that catch my eye.
It’s not a rigid framework, more like “here’s what I found, this is what it means, maybe you can use it too.”

Writeups & Notes

I document experiments, thoughts, failures, and little insights that pop up along the way.
Everything is cleaned enough to share, but I keep the raw vibe, so it’s more like reading my lab notebook than a corporate report.

Ethics

All of it is safe and contained.
If something touches the outside world, it’s with permission and responsibility.
Otherwise, it’s all ideas, experiments, and learning.

# Proof / How to Check My Work

GitHub repos (this profile)

Screenshots, diagrams, notes

Sometimes PDFs summarizing what I’ve learned
