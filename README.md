# About Me

I explore security concepts responsibly within isolated labs, emphasizing understanding over exploitation.  
My work revolves around conceptual penetration testing, threat modeling, and deriving practical insights that promote learning and safe experimentation.  
All assessments are documented carefully—from initial assumptions to findings and mitigation strategies—to encourage responsible security research and disclosure.
